# IDA Pro plugin for loading .MAP symbol files

Loads a VC/Borland/Dede/GCC/IDA `.map` file into IDA Database.

This repository is a modified fork ([see original](https://github.com/mefistotelis/ida-pro-loadmap)). It has been modified to make use of [ida-cmake](https://github.com/allthingsida/ida-cmake), and can now be compiled for IDA 9.0 on Windows, macOS and Linux.
